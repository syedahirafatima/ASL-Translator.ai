# American Sign Language Alphabet Recognizer
‚úîÔ∏è A Python project that recognizes the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. <br>
‚úîÔ∏è This project can translate hand signs into both **text** and **voice** in real-time.


## üí° Why I Built This Project
1. **Promote Accessibility:** Help bridge communication gaps for deaf and mute individuals ‚ôø 
2. **Enhance Human Connection:** Translate ASL into text and voice for smoother interaction.  
3. **Hands-On AI Learning:** Apply Python, OpenCV, and CNNs to a real-world problem üíª
4. **Real-Time Recognition:** Detect ASL alphabets live using webcam input üé• 
5. **Text & Voice Output:** Make recognition practical with readable and spoken results.  
6. **Open-Source Contribution:** Provide a project others can learn from.
7. **Neural Network Experimentation:** Explore model accuracy and preprocessing techniques üß†
8. **Technology Serving Humanity:** Use AI to create meaningful impact in people‚Äôs lives ‚ù§Ô∏è

## How to Run the Project

This project uses **Python**, **OpenCV**, and a **pre-trained CNN model** to recognize ASL alphabets from images or webcam input.

### 1. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/syedahirafatima/ASL-Translator.ai
cd ASL-Translator.ai
```

### 2. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+). All teh dependencies needed are in the `requirements.txt`, so install the required packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Translator

To start recognizing ASL alphabets in real-time via webcam, run:
```bash
python translator.py
```

## Project Structure
1. `ASL.ipynb` ‚Äì Jupyter notebook for experimenting with the model.<br>
2. `predict.py` ‚Äì Contains functions to preprocess images and predict ASL alphabets.<br>
3. `translator.py` ‚Äì Main script to translate webcam input into text and voice.<br>
4. `variables.py` ‚Äì Stores project paths and configuration variables.<br>
5. `model.h5` ‚Äì Pre-trained CNN model for ASL recognition.<br>
6. `dataset/` ‚Äì Folder containing the ASL dataset (if needed for training or testing).<br>
7. `alphabet.png` ‚Äì Reference image of the ASL alphabet.<br>
8. `requirements.txt` - contains all the dependencies<br>
