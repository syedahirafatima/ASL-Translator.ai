# American Sign Language Alphabet Recognizer
‚úîÔ∏è A Python project that recognizes the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV. <br>
‚úîÔ∏è This project can translate hand signs into both **text** and **voice** in real-time.

# Real-Time ASL Alphabet Recognition (Demo Screenshots)
Below are demo screenshots showing how the ASL Translator detects and predicts American Sign Language alphabets in real time.<br>
Here, it recognizes the sequence H-E-L-L-O üëã demonstrating accurate detection for multiple letters.

# Trained ASL Alphabets Overview
The ASL Translator model has been trained on A‚ÄìZ American Sign Language alphabets. <br>
Each alphabet is represented by multiple hand gesture samples to help the model learn shape variations and improve accuracy. <br>

## üí° Why I Built This Project
1. **Promote Accessibility:** Help bridge communication gaps for deaf and mute individuals ‚ôø <br>
2. **Enhance Human Connection:** Translate ASL into text and voice for smoother interaction.  <br>
3. **Hands-On AI Learning:** Apply Python, OpenCV, and CNNs to a real-world problem üíª<br>
4. **Real-Time Recognition:** Detect ASL alphabets live using webcam input üé• <br>
5. **Text & Voice Output:** Make recognition practical with readable and spoken results.  <br>
6. **Open-Source Contribution:** Provide a project others can learn from.<br>
7. **Neural Network Experimentation:** Explore model accuracy and preprocessing techniques üß†<br>
8. **Technology Serving Humanity:** Use AI to create meaningful impact in people‚Äôs lives ‚ù§Ô∏è<br>

## How to Run the Project

This project uses **Python**, **OpenCV**, and a **pre-trained CNN model** to recognize ASL alphabets from images or webcam input.
